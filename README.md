# CS194N: Deep Learning (Spring 2018)

### HW1
Implementation of linear regression, shallow neural network for MNIST classification, and KNN on CIFAR-10 classification. It also includes a feature visualization for the NN model and some other analysis.

**Used packages:** tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, pandas

### HW2
Implementation of 4-layer neural network from scratch. The visualization of the final calssification region is implemented and analysed. The dataset I used is a simple XOR with 4 data points. Certain noise is added for further analysis of the NN generalization ability. The pdf version of the report is also in the folder.

**Used packages:** matplotlib, seaborn

### Project
AVA-II dataset is a video activity recognition . ResNet models are implemented on single image grames. Check [this](https://github.com/derenlei/AVA-II) repo for detail implementation.

**Used packages:** tensorflow, numpy, pandas, cv2, os
